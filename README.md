### Agent RL vs Human
In this mode, the Q-learning agent plays against a human player. The agent learns from its actions and tries to beat the human player.

### Agent RL vs Agent RL
In this mode, two Q-learning agents play against each other. Both agents learn from their actions and try to beat each other.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this Pong game with Q-learning agent is a fun and interactive way to learn about reinforcement learning and the Q-learning algorithm. The game allows you to play against an AI player or a human player, or even watch two agents play against each other. The agent's performance can be analyzed using the reward plot, which shows how the agent improves over time.

Enjoy playing!
